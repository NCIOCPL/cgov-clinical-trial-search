# NCIOCPL\ClinicalTrialSearch\ApiClient

This is the client for making the actual connection to the NCI Clinical Trial API.
Note that this code was generated from the API's swagger document, via the
[swagger-codegen tool](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/), however the swagger
document does not include details of the data returns, requiring the generated library
to be modified to include data models and to return values from API calls.
